# üí° Examples

-   If you want to share a customized URL and text, such as sharing information about "ChatGPT," you can use the following code to set the URL and text of "ChatGPT" for sharing.

```js
sharer.setURl("https://chat.openai.com/").setText("ChatGPT").open();
```

-   If you want to set URL and text to default, you can use the following code.

`NOTE: By default, the URL and text values are automatically set to the URL and title of the current page, respectively.`

```js
sharer.setDefaultURL().setDefaultText().open();
```
